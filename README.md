Choose your adventure is a web-based simulation game that allows the player to choose their path of becoming a software engineer. When the user clicks "play now" the game begins by giving a prompt.  Based on the player's button selection, the next prompt will appear on click. The story will take you through several events based on your selection. The player will have two choices that can lead to a different path or lead to the next prompt.
